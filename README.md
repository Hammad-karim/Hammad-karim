# Hi, I'm Hammad Karim 👋

**Computer Science Student | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Teaching Assistant**

I am a motivated Computer Science student with a strong foundation in programming, computer networks, and software engineering principles. I enjoy building structured, problem-oriented projects and continuously improving my technical skills. My primary area of interest is cybersecurity, where I am actively exploring ethical hacking, network security, and vulnerability analysis.

Alongside my studies, I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for Digital Logic Design,Assembly Language(COAL) and Linear Algebra where I supported students in understanding core concepts and assisted in evaluating academic assessments. I value clean design, clear documentation, and practical learning through projects.
